The [csv](./csv) folder contains the tables in [UBC sandhi charts](./UBC_sandhi_charts.odt) in the SLP encoding.

Each table from UBC website (in Sanskrit Roman encoding) has been transcoded in SLP and manually "unpacked" 
so that the SLP table readily contains all the special cases and the exceptions.
