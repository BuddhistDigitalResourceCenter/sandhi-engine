The [csv](./csv) folder contains the tables in [UBC sandhi charts](./UBC_sandhi_charts.ods) in the SLP encoding.

Each table from UBC website has been expanded(manually) wherever necessary to accomodate all the special cases and exceptions:
 - rows or columns have been added (the parser deduplicates entries in the tables)
 - the characters surrounding the sandhied string have been added to accomodate rules that apply contextually
